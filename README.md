# Deep-Learning
This repository contains code and visualizations for Assignment 1 of the Deep Learning course at IIT Mandi, guided by Dr.Aditya Nigam. The assignment is divided into two parts focusing on Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for classification tasks.


ðŸ“Œ Part I â€“ Classification using Perceptron (From Scratch)
ðŸ“‚ Datasets:
Dataset 1 â€“ Linearly Separable (LS):

3 classes, 2D, 500 samples/class

Dataset 2 â€“ Non-Linearly Separable (NLS):

3 classes, 2D, custom sample count/class

Split: 70% train, 30% test

ðŸ§  Model:
Perceptron with Sigmoid/Step Activation

One-vs-One Classification Approach

Backpropagation implemented from scratch

ðŸ“Š Visualizations and Analysis:
Training & Test dataset plots

Error vs Epochs curve

Decision region plots for each pair of classes & combined

Confusion matrix & accuracy

Discussion on activation choice and inference

ðŸ“Œ Part II â€“ MNIST Digit Classification
ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
MNIST: 60,000 train images, 10,000 test images

Each image: 28x28 grayscale (flattened to 784 features)

ðŸ§  Models:
Model 1 â€“ MLP from Scratch (NumPy only)

Model 2 â€“ CNN using Deep Learning Framework (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras)

ðŸ“Š Evaluation:
Sample image visualizations

Network architecture (MLP & CNN)

Choice of activation and loss functions

Error vs Epochs plot

Confusion matrix and accuracy

Comparative inference of MLP and CNN performance
